# Crunchy Nav

Crunchy Nav is a browser extension which aims to make the Crunchyroll website easier to navigate when using a keyboard (arrow keys), gamepad (joystick, d-pad), or remote control.

It removes unnecessary elements from the web page and allows you to highlight different anime series by using directional controls.

This makes the user interface similar to how Crunchyroll works on other platforms, such as on Android TV or on video game consoles.

## Current Status

Most of the basic functionality is done, but the extension isn't quite usable yet.

It also needs testing with different browsers (currently only tested on Firefox) and screen sizes.

## Warning: occasional breakages expected

This extension works by parsing the Crunchyroll website's DOM and searching for known tags.

It expects certain elements to exist in a certain format.

As such, any changes to the website will likely break this extension.
